# Flutter Testing Concept with a Cubit Counter

This repository presents a proof of concept specifically centered on **testing Flutter applications** utilizing the Cubit (BloC) pattern for effective state management. The included source code in this repository is not just a demonstration of the possibility but provides a practical example on how to conduct tests for both the user interface (UI) and the business logic using bloc/cubit. It details the approach to testing a simple counter implemented with Cubit, offering a clear example of how to effectively test such a feature in a Flutter application.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts:

### Widget Tests
Focused on verifying the behavior of the user interface, including widgets and their interaction with the user.
### Cubit Tests
Dedicated to testing the business logic implemented using the Cubit pattern, ensuring that states are managed correctly.
